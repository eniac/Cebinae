# Cebinae

### Description

Cebinae is a switch infrastructure that mitigates unfairness using distributed local state verifications & reactions, with no changes to the legacy end host CCAs.

### Main Content

* `cebinae.py`: The global utility script to drive a set of experiments and commands.
* `ns/`: ns-3.35 source tree with cebinae module and experiment instances.
    * `configs/`: List of json configuration files as input to launch experiments.
    * `index/`: Reference experiment output results.
    * `cebinae/`: Experiement instances.
* `vm/`: Scripts to set up VM env with tofino SDE.
* `vm_prebuild`: Directory to place and launch the prebuilt VM instance.
* `tofino_prototpye`: Cebinae's P4-16 implementation and C++ control plane agent tested on the Wedge100BF-32X Tofino switch.
* `vm_experiments.md`: Instructions to reproduce the resource table and top flow detection result without requiring physical Tofino switch.

### Artifact Evaluation README

Below are the instructions to reproduce the major results in the paper manuscript.
For the ease of running the evaluation process, `cebinae.py` is created as the main entry point to experiement launches and analysis/plotting scripts to reproduce the results/graphs in the paper.

**Environment Setup**

* Clone/fetch the **latest version** of the repository: `git clone https://github.com/eniac/Cebinae`.

* For the reproduction of the majority of results, only a canonical Linux machine (e.g., Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04 LTS) is required. Other Linux distributions and OS are also expected to work, preferably Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

* Validate environment set up.
    * `which python` points to `python3` or change the commands below to python3.
    * `python cebinae.py ns validate -p optimized` to validate if the environment is well set up, which typically takes around 15 min. Upon failure of compilation or tests, check if the [prerequisite packages](https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/Installation#Ubuntu.2FDebian.2FMint) are installed for the corresponding platform, for instance, gcc >= 7.0.0. For Ubuntu 18.04, `python cebinae.py ns prerequisite` auto-installs the set of packages needed.
    * Confirm that [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) is installed by typing `gnuplot` in the linux prompt and type `q` to quit its terminal.

* (Optional) A physical Barefoot Tofino switch (tested end-to-end with `bf-sde-9.5.0`) connecting to a testbed of 6 servers with Mellanox Technologies MT27710 Family [ConnectX-4 Lx] 10G/25G NIC.
    * Feel free to skip for artifact evaluation, as the majority of results in the paper are executed in ns-3.35 (that allows interating various environment conditions, and prevent randomness for fair comparative studies versus the alternatives with the same exact background condition) or Tofino VMs.
    * For the results conducted on Tofino switch (e.g., data plane resource, top flow detection), one could reproduce the same result with Tofino ASIC model VM. We provided the scripts under `vm` directory to set up the environment.
    * **TLDR**: We understand that setting up the env (e.g., installing the exact version `bf-sde-9.5.0`, downloading CAIDA traces) may be time consuming, hence, we've provided a prebuilt VM instance for the ease of the evaluation process (see next bullet point).

* We provided a pre-built VM instance with `bf-sde-9.5.0` for artifact evaluation process to validate the HW results in the accepted paper manuscript without the need of physical testbed set up. See [detailed instructions](https://github.com/eniac/Cebinae/blob/main/vm_experiments.md).

**Reproduce Figure 1 Illustrative Example**

* Before launching any experiments, run `python cebinae.py ns configure -p optimized` and `python cebinae.py ns build` to configure and build with optimized build profile for faster execution.
* Run the experiment batch: `python cebinae.py ns run_batch -c fig1.json` (takes ~2 min, or ~1min if with `--parallel` flag). The tracing outputs of the experiments will appear under temporary created direcotry `ns/tmp_index/fig1/` by default.
* Plot Figure 1: `python cebinae.py plot --plot_target fig1 --data_path ns/tmp_index/fig1/`. The output plot `figure1.eps` will show up under `ns/tmp_index/fig1/`.
* Expected outputs and plots are also stored under `ns/index/fig1/` for reference. The `*.eps` plot can be displayed by any EPS Viewer (e.g., Mac's built-in reader) via `open *.eps`.

**Reproduce Table 2**

* `ns/configs/tbl2/` stores the configuration of experiments for the batch (3 instances) of experiments for each row, for instance, `ns/configs/tbl2/r0.json` corresponds to row 0 in the table.
* Run the experiment batches for each row, for instance `r0.json`:
    * Run `python cebinae.py ns run_batch -c tbl2/r0.json --parallel` to decompose the batch instances for parallel execution, the results will appear under `ns/tmp_index/tbl2/r0/`.
    * Run `python cebinae.py parse --target bigtbl --data_path ns/tmp_index/tbl2/r0` to print the corresponding parsed results from digest files of each experiment instance to the terminal.
* Alternatively, one could also run `python cebinae.py ns run_instances -c tbl2 --parallel` (takes ~3 hours) in single command that will run all experiment configs under the specified directory `ns/configs/tbl2/` and exploits the underlying multi-core architecture if any via multiprocessing pool.
    * If any experiment instance fails (due to occasional file reads/writes failure with multi-processing), one could always return to the previous `run_batch` command for re-executing the specific batch.
* We understand that re-running all experiments may be computationally expensive. Therefore, all reference results and the parsed row print are stored under the corresponding row subdirectory of `ns/index/tbl2/`, the digest file contains the expected completion time (on Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4110 CPU @ 2.10GHz) for the corresponding experiment instance.

**Reproduce Figure 7**

* Run `python cebinae.py ns run_batch -c fig7.json --parallel`, results will appear under `ns/tmp_index/fig7/`.
* Parse the result and plot figure 7: `python cebinae.py plot --plot_target fig7 --data_path ns/tmp_index/fig7/`. The resulting `fig7.eps` will appear under `ns/tmp_index/fig7/`.
* `ns/index/fig7/` also stores the reference output and graph.

**Reproduce Figure 8**

* Run `python cebinae.py ns run_batch -c fig8.json --parallel`, results will appear under `ns/tmp_index/fig8/`.
* Parse the result and plot figure 8: `python cebinae.py plot --plot_target fig8 --data_path ns/tmp_index/fig8/`. The resulting `*.eps` will appear under `ns/tmp_index/fig8/`.
* `ns/index/fig8/` also stores the reference output and graph.

**Reproduce Table 3 Hardware Resource Usage**

**Reproduce Figure 9**

**Sanity check of pseudocode in Figure 4 & 5 & 6**

Major pointer to files related to the instantiation of the data plane & control plane operations:

* [Cebinae QueueDisc](https://github.com/eniac/Cebinae/blob/main/ns/src/traffic-control/model/cebinae-queue-disc.cc) encoding the data plane (Figure 5) and control plane operations (Figure 4) in ns-3.35; [example log](https://github.com/eniac/Cebinae/blob/main/ns/index/fig1/cebinae/cebinae_debug) that reflects the Figure 6 timeline for an illustrative 2-flow scenario.
* [P4 main](https://github.com/eniac/Cebinae/blob/main/tofino_prototype/main.p4) and [C++ control plane main](https://github.com/eniac/Cebinae/blob/main/tofino_prototype/main.cpp).
