At present, most of the available documentation about testing and validation
exists in publications, some of which are referenced below.

Error model
***********

Validation results for the 802.11b error model are available in this
`technical report <http://www.nsnam.org/~pei/80211b.pdf>`__

Two clarifications on the results should be noted.  First, Figure 1-4
of the above reference
corresponds to the |ns3| NIST BER model.   In the program in the 
Appendix of the paper (80211b.c), there are two constants used to generate
the data.  The first, packet size, is set to 1024 bytes.  The second,
"noise", is set to a value of 7 dB; this was empirically picked to align
the curves the best with the reported data from the CMU testbed.  Although
a value of 1.55 dB would correspond to the reported -99 dBm noise floor
from the CMU paper, a noise figure of 7 dB results in the best fit with the
CMU experimental data.  This default of 7 dB is the RxNoiseFigure in the
``ns3::YansWifiPhy`` model.  Other values for noise figure will shift the 
curves leftward or rightward but not change the slope. 

The curves can be reproduced by running the ``wifi-clear-channel-cmu.cc`` 
example program in the ``examples/wireless`` directory, and the figure produced
(when GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is enabled) is reproduced below in 
Figure :ref:`fig-clear-channel-80211b`.

Validation results for the 802.11a/g OFDM error model are available in this
`technical report <https://www.nsnam.org/~pei/80211ofdm.pdf>`__.  The curves
can be reproduced by running the ``wifi-ofdm-validation.cc`` example program
in the ``examples/wireless`` directory, and the figure is reproduced below
in Figure :ref:`fig-nist-frame-success-rate`.

Similar curves for 802.11n/ac/ax can be obtained by running the ``wifi-ofdm-ht-validation.cc``,
``wifi-ofdm-vht-validation.cc`` and ``wifi-ofdm-he-validation.cc`` example programs
in the ``examples/wireless`` directory, and the figures are reproduced below
in Figure :ref:`fig-nist-frame-success-rate-n`, Figure :ref:`fig-nist-frame-success-rate-ac`
and Figure :ref:`fig-nist-frame-success-rate-ax`, respectively.
There is no validation for those curves yet.

MAC validation
**************
Validation of the 802.11 DCF MAC layer has been performed in [baldo2010]_.

802.11 PCF operation has been verified by running 'wifi-pcf' example with PCAP files generation enabled, and observing the frame exchange using Wireshark.

SpectrumWiFiPhy
***************

The SpectrumWifiPhy implementation has been verified to produce equivalent
results to the legacy YansWifiPhy by using the saturation and packet
error rate programs (described below) and toggling the implementation 
between the two physical layers.

A basic unit test is provided using injection of hand-crafted packets to
a receiving Phy object, controlling the timing and receive power of 
each packet arrival and checking the reception results.  However, most of
the testing of this Phy implementation has been performed using example
programs described below, and during the course of a (separate) LTE/Wi-Fi
coexistence study not documented herein.

Saturation performance
======================

The program ``examples/wireless/wifi-spectrum-saturation-example.cc``
allows user to select either the `SpectrumWifiPhy` or `YansWifiPhy` for
saturation tests.  The wifiType can be toggled by the argument
``'--wifiType=ns3::YansWifiPhy'`` or ``--wifiType=ns3::SpectrumWifiPhy'``

There isn't any difference in the output, which is to be expected because
this test is more of a test of the DCF than the physical layer.

By default, the program will use the `SpectrumWifiPhy` and will run
for 10 seconds of saturating UDP data, with 802.11n features enabled.
It produces this output for the main 802.11n rates (with short and long guard
intervals):

::

  wifiType: ns3::SpectrumWifiPhy distance: 1m
  index   MCS   width Rate (Mb/s) Tput (Mb/s) Received 
      0     0      20       6.5     5.81381    4937
      1     1      20        13     11.8266   10043
      2     2      20      19.5     17.7935   15110
      3     3      20        26     23.7958   20207
      4     4      20        39     35.7331   30344
      5     5      20        52     47.6174   40436
      6     6      20      58.5     53.6102   45525
      7     7      20        65     59.5501   50569
    ...
     63    15      40       300     254.902  216459


The above output shows the first 8 (of 32) modes, and last mode, that will be
output from the program.  The first 8 modes correspond
to short guard interval disabled and channel bonding disabled.  The
subsequent 24 modes run by this program are variations with short guard
interval enabled (cases 9-16), and then with channel bonding enabled and
short guard first disabled then enabled (cases 17-32).  Cases 33-64 repeat
the same configurations but for two spatial streams (MIMO abstraction).

When run with the legacy YansWifiPhy, as in ``./waf --run "wifi-spectrum-saturation-example --wifiType=ns3::YansWifiPhy"``, the same output is observed:

::

  wifiType: ns3::YansWifiPhy distance: 1m
  index   MCS   width Rate (Mb/s) Tput (Mb/s) Received 
      0     0      20       6.5     5.81381    4937
      1     1      20        13     11.8266   10043
      2     2      20      19.5     17.7935   15110
      3     3      20        26     23.7958   20207
    ...

This is to be expected since YansWifiPhy and SpectrumWifiPhy use the 
same error rate model in this case.

Packet error rate performance
=============================

The program ``examples/wireless/wifi-spectrum-per-example.cc`` allows users
to select either `SpectrumWifiPhy` or `YansWifiPhy`, as above, and select
the distance between the nodes, and to log the reception statistics and
received SNR (as observed by the WifiPhy::MonitorSnifferRx trace source), using a
Friis propagation loss model.  The transmit power is lowered from the default
of 40 mW (16 dBm) to 1 dBm to lower the baseline SNR; the distance between
the nodes can be changed to further change the SNR.  By default, it steps 
through the same index values as in the saturation example (0 through 31) 
for a 50m distance, for 10 seconds of simulation time, producing output such as:

::

  wifiType: ns3::SpectrumWifiPhy distance: 50m; time: 10; TxPower: 1 dBm (1.3 mW)
  index   MCS  Rate (Mb/s) Tput (Mb/s) Received Signal (dBm) Noise (dBm) SNR (dB)
      0     0      6.50        5.77    7414      -79.71      -93.97       14.25
      1     1     13.00       11.58   14892      -79.71      -93.97       14.25
      2     2     19.50       17.39   22358      -79.71      -93.97       14.25
      3     3     26.00       22.96   29521      -79.71      -93.97       14.25
      4     4     39.00        0.00       0         N/A         N/A         N/A
      5     5     52.00        0.00       0         N/A         N/A         N/A
      6     6     58.50        0.00       0         N/A         N/A         N/A
      7     7     65.00        0.00       0         N/A         N/A         N/A
  
As in the above saturation example, running this program with YansWifiPhy
will yield identical output.

Interference performance
========================

The program ``examples/wireless/wifi-spectrum-per-interference.cc`` is based
on the previous packet error rate example, but copies over the
WaveformGenerator from the unlicensed LTE interferer test, to allow
users to inject a non-Wi-Fi signal (using the ``--waveformPower`` argument)
from the command line.  Another difference with respect to the packet
error rate example program is that the transmit power is set back to the
default of 40 mW (16 dBm).  By default, the interference generator is off,
and the program should behave similarly to the other packet error rate example,
but by adding small
amounts of power (e.g. ``--waveformPower=0.001``), one will start to observe
SNR degradation and frame loss.

Some sample output with default arguments (no interference) is:

::

  ./waf --run "wifi-spectrum-per-interference"

  wifiType: ns3::SpectrumWifiPhy distance: 50m; time: 10; TxPower: 16 dBm (40 mW)
  index   MCS  Rate (Mb/s) Tput (Mb/s) Received Signal (dBm)Noi+Inf(dBm) SNR (dB)
      0     0      6.50        5.77    7414      -64.69      -93.97       29.27
      1     1     13.00       11.58   14892      -64.69      -93.97       29.27
      2     2     19.50       17.39   22358      -64.69      -93.97       29.27
      3     3     26.00       23.23   29875      -64.69      -93.97       29.27
      4     4     39.00       34.90   44877      -64.69      -93.97       29.27
      5     5     52.00       46.51   59813      -64.69      -93.97       29.27
      6     6     58.50       52.39   67374      -64.69      -93.97       29.27
      7     7     65.00       58.18   74819      -64.69      -93.97       29.27
    ...

while a small amount of waveform power will cause frame losses to occur at
higher order modulations, due to lower SNR:

::

  ./waf --run "wifi-spectrum-per-interference --waveformPower=0.001"

  wifiType: ns3::SpectrumWifiPhy distance: 50m; sent: 1000 TxPower: 16 dBm (40 mW)
  index   MCS Rate (Mb/s) Tput (Mb/s) Received Signal (dBm)Noi+Inf(dBm)  SNR (dB)
      0     0      6.50        5.77    7414      -64.69      -80.08       15.38
      1     1     13.00       11.58   14892      -64.69      -80.08       15.38
      2     2     19.50       17.39   22358      -64.69      -80.08       15.38
      3     3     26.00       23.23   29873      -64.69      -80.08       15.38
      4     4     39.00        0.41     531      -64.69      -80.08       15.38
      5     5     52.00        0.00       0         N/A         N/A         N/A
      6     6     58.50        0.00       0         N/A         N/A         N/A
      7     7     65.00        0.00       0         N/A         N/A         N/A
    ...

If ns3::YansWifiPhy is selected as the wifiType, the waveform generator will
not be enabled because only transmitters of type YansWifiPhy may be connected
to a YansWifiChannel.

The interference signal as received by the sending node is typically below 
the default -62 dBm CCA Mode 1 threshold in this example.  If it raises
above, the sending node will suppress all transmissions.

Bianchi validation
******************

The program ``src/wifi/examples/wifi-bianchi.cc`` allows user to
compare ns-3 simulation results against the Bianchi model
presented in [bianchi2000]_ and [bianchi2005]_.

The MATLAB code used to generate the Bianchi model,
as well as the generated outputs, are provided in
the folder ``src/wifi/examples/reference``.
User can regenerate Bianchi results by running
``generate_bianchi.m`` in MATLAB.

By default, the program ``src/wifi/examples/wifi-bianchi.cc``
simulates an 802.11a adhoc ring scenario, with a PHY rate set to 
54 Mbit/s, and loop from 5 stations to 50 stations, by a step of 
5 stations. It generates a plt file, which allows user to quickly
generate an eps file using gnuplot and vizualize the graph.

::

  ./waf --run "wifi-bianchi"

.. _fig-wifi-bianchi-11a-54-adhoc:

   :align: center

   Bianchi throughput validation results for 802.11a 54 Mbps in adhoc configuration

The user has the possibility to select the standard (only
11a, 11b or 11g currently supported), to select the PHY rate (in Mbit/s),
as well as to choose between an adhoc or an infrastructure configuration.

When run for 802.11g 6 Mbit/s in infrastucture mode, the output is:

::

  ./waf --run "wifi-bianchi --standard=11g --phyRate=6 --duration=500 --infra"

Multi-user transmissions validation
***********************************

The implementation of the OFDMA support has been validated against a theoretical model [magrin2021mu]_ .

A preliminary evaluation of the usage of OFDMA in 802.11ax, in terms of latency in non-saturated
conditions, throughput in saturated conditions and transmission range with UL OFDMA, is provided
in [avallone2021wcm]_ .
