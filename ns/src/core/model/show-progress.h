/**

 *
 * Periodically print a status message indicating simulator progress.
 *
 * Print a status message showing the simulator time and
 * execution speed, relative to wall clock time, as well as the number
 * of events executed each interval of wall clock time.
 *
 * The output interval is based on wall clock time, rather than simulation
 * time, to avoid too many events for fast simulations, and too long of
 * a reporting interval for very slow simulations.
 *
 * The target update interval (and output stream) can be configured
 * at construction.  The default output stream, if unspecified, is cout.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * \code
 *     int main (int arg, char ** argv)
 *     {
 *       // Create your model
 *
 *       ShowProgress progress (Seconds (10), std::cerr);
 *       Simulator::Run ();
 *       Simulator::Destroy ();
 *     }
 * \endcode
 *
 * This generates output similar to the following:
 *
 * \code
 *     Start wall clock: Tue May 19 10:24:07 2020
 *     +17.179869183s (   4.937x real time) 29559 events processed
 *     +25.769803775s (   4.965x real time) 45179 events processed
 *     +51.539607551s (   8.810x real time) 49421 events processed
 *     +90.324463739s (   7.607x real time) 58021 events processed
 *     +129.770882188s (   7.576x real time) 53850 events processed
 *     +170.958751090s (   8.321x real time) 56473 events processed
 *     +194.339562435s (  12.776x real time) 30957 events processed
 *     End wall clock:  Tue May 19 10:24:23 2020
 *     Elapsed wall clock: 16s
 * \endcode
 *
 * A more extensive example of use is provided in sample-show-progress.cc.

 * Based on a python version by Gustavo Carneiro <gjcarneiro@gmail.com>,
