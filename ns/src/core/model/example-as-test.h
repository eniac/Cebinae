/**
 * \ingroup testing
 * Execute an example program as a test suite.
 *
 * You can use this TestSuite to add an example to the test suite with
 * checking of the example output (`std::out` and `std::err`).  This
 * is an alternative to adding an example using the
 * `examples-to-run.py` file. The key difference between the two
 * methods is what criteria is used to for success.  Examples added to
 * `examples-to-run.py` will be run and the exit status checked
 * (non-zero indicates failure).  ExampleAsTestSuite adds checking of
 * output against a specified known "good" reference file.  
 *
 * \warning If you are thinking about using this class, strongly
 * consider using a standard test instead.  The TestSuite class has
 * better checking using the NS_TEST_* macros and in almost all cases
 * is the better approach.  If your test can be done with a TestSuite
 * class you will be asked by the reviewers to rewrite the test when
 * you do a pull request.
 *
 * \par Test Addition
 *
 * To use an example program as a test you need to create a test suite
 * file and add it to the appropriate list in your module wscript
 * file. The "good" output reference file needs to be generated for
 * detecting regressions.
 *
 * Let's assume your module is called `mymodule`, and the example
 * program is `mymodule/examples/mod-example.cc`.  First you should
 * create a test file `mymodule/test/mymodule-examples-test-suite.cc`
 * which looks like this:
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * #include "ns3/example-as-test.h"
 * static ns3::ExampleAsTestSuite g_modExampleOne ("mymodule-example-mod-example-one", "mod-example", NS_TEST_SOURCEDIR, "--arg-one");
 * static ns3::ExampleAsTestSuite g_modExampleTwo ("mymodule-example-mod-example-two", "mod-example", NS_TEST_SOURCEDIR, "--arg-two");
 * \endcode
 *
 * The arguments to the constructor is the name of the test suite, the
 * example to run, the directory that contains the "good" reference file
 * (the macro `NS_TEST_SOURCEDIR` is normally the correct directory),
 * and command line arguments for the example.  In the preceding code
 * the same example is run twice with different arguments.
 *
 * You then need to add that newly created test suite file to the list
 * of test sources in `mymodule/wscript`.   Building of examples
 * is an option so you need to guard the inclusion of the test suite:
 *
 * \code{.py}
 * if (bld.env['ENABLE_EXAMPLES']):
 *    module.source.append('model/mymodule-examples-test-suite.cc')
 * \endcode
 *
 * Since you modified a wscript file you need to reconfigure and
 * rebuild everything.
 *
 * You just added new tests so you will need to generate the "good"
 * output reference files that will be used to verify the example:
 *
 * `./test.py --suite="mymodule-example-*" --update`
 *
 * This will run all tests starting with "mymodule-example-" and save
 * new "good" reference files.  Updating the reference file should be
 * done when you create the test and whenever output changes.  When
 * updating the reference output you should inspect it to ensure that
 * it is valid.  The reference files should be committed with the new
 * test.
 *
 * \par Test Verification
 *
 * You can run the test with the standard `test.py` script.  For
 * example to run the suites you just added:
 *
 * `./test.py --suite="mymodule-example-*"`
 *
 * This will run all `mymodule-example-...` tests and report whether they
 * produce output matching the reference files.
 * 
 * \par Writing good examples for testing
 *
 * When setting up an example for use by this class you should be very
 * careful about what output the example generates.  For example,
 * writing output which includes simulation time (especially high
 * resolution time) makes the test sensitive to potentially minor
 * changes in event times.  This makes the reference output hard to
 * verify and hard to keep up-to-date.  Output as little as needed for
 * the example and include only behavioral state that is important for
 * determining if the example has run correctly.
