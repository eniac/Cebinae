 * in place for years). The congestion control is split from the main

 * variables are maintained in the TcpSocketState class, while subclasses of
 * TcpCongestionOps operate over an instance of that class.
 *
 * Only three methods have been implemented right now; however, Linux has many others,
 * which can be added later in ns-3.
